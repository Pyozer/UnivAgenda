# Why my university is not present

You can't find your university in the list?

## Origin of the problem

It is highly possible that your university has not been added.
Indeed, each university is added one by one and manually.

Currently is present only Le Mans University, University of Tours, Rennes and INSA Rennes.

It may be that yours was not added because:

- No one has asked to add it, so it has not been added.
- Or because your university uses a system that does not allow the application to be able to get the calendars.

If you can't wait and you want to have your calendar into the app, you can use an URL of an ICAL file (Get the link from the Calendar Export feature of your University website).

## Solution

To add your university to the application, go back to the Help page, go to Feedback and contact us.
Before send your email, please specify:

- The name of your university
- The URL of the login page to the ENT (so that we can check if it is possible to add your university)
- If possible, the generated URL when you want to export your calendar (by going in Export then Generate a URL)

We will come back to you later to add the different calendars to the application.
